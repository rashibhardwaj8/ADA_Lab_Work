Algorithm Design & Analysis – Unit 1-4 Lab (Java Implementation)
Overview
This repository contains Java implementations of fundamental algorithms from Algorithm Design & Analysis (ADA), along with empirical analysis of sorting algorithms. The project demonstrates core paradigms including Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Divide & Conquer, and Backtracking, and includes performance evaluation using step counts and graphical visualization.

Implemented Algorithms
1. Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Each algorithm is implemented with:

Ascending and descending order support
Step count tracking (comparisons + swaps)
Analysis across best, average, and worst cases
2. Searching Algorithms
Linear Search
Binary Search
3. Greedy Algorithms
Fractional Knapsack
Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm
4. Dynamic Programming
0/1 Knapsack
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
Bellman-Ford Algorithm
5. Divide & Conquer
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Matrix Multiplication
6. Backtracking
N-Queens Problem
Sorting Analysis
The project includes an empirical analysis of sorting algorithms:

Input Cases
Best Case (sorted)
Average Case (random)
Worst Case (reverse sorted)
Metrics
Step count (basic operations)
Input sizes: 10, 20, 30, 40
Output
Console output showing sorted arrays and step counts

CSV file (results.csv) storing:

Algorithm, Input Size, Steps
Graph Visualization
Graphs are generated using Python (matplotlib).

Steps to Generate Graphs
Run Java program:

javac sorting_analysis.java
java sorting_analysis
Ensure results.csv is created

Run Python script:

python plot_graph.py
Output:

Graph displayed OR

Key Concepts Demonstrated
Time complexity vs empirical analysis
Greedy vs Dynamic Programming trade-offs
Recursion and backtracking
Data structures (arrays, lists, maps, priority queues)
Algorithm optimization techniques
Requirements
Java
JDK 8 or higher
Python (for graphs)
Python 3.x

Libraries:

pip install matplotlib pandas
Observations
Bubble and Selection Sort show O(n²) growth
Insertion Sort performs better on nearly sorted data
Step count increases significantly with input size
Graphs clearly illustrate performance differences
Future Improvements
Add Merge Sort and Quick Sort to analysis
Include runtime benchmarking (System.nanoTime)
Separate graphs for best/average/worst cases
Use advanced visualization (Seaborn / JFreeChart)
Implement space optimization techniques
